# 25x25
We envision a city where the bus is never stuck in traffic. Where children can bike themselves to school. Where green space dots every corner of the city. Where everyone can get where they're going quickly, with dignity and joy.

LA 25x25 is a challenge to our next leaders to build a more accessible green healthy and productive city by giving public space back to people.
